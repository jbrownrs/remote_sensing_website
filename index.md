# Introduction 

## What is remote sensing?

The term 'remote sensing' was coined in the early 1960s by Evelyn Pruitt at the 
Geography Branch of the US Office of Naval Research [[1]](#1). Remote sensing 
is acquiring information about objects or phenomena, without direct contact, by measuring 
emitted and reflected electromagnetic radiation. The term Earth Observation refers to remote sensing 
of the Earth's systems.
